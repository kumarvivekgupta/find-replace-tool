# Find and Replace Tool

This is a simple Find and Replace tool built with Angular 19. It allows users to enter text, find a specific word or phrase, and replace it with another word or phrase.

## Features
- Input area to enter the original text.
- Fields to enter the word/phrase to find and the replacement word/phrase.
- Display the result after the replacement operation.
- Supports replacing all occurrences of the found text.

## Assumptions
- The "Find" operation is case-insensitive.
- Replaces all instances of the text.
- Empty text disables the button

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `ng serve` to start the application.

Visit `http://localhost:4200/` to use the tool.

## Future Improvements
- Case-sensitive search.
- Ability to replace only the first occurrence.
- Show count of replaced occurrences and realtime highlight.
